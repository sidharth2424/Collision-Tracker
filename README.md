# ⚙️ 1D Elastic Collision Simulator

A browser-based physics simulation that models **1D elastic collisions** between two objects (like boats) moving along a straight path. The simulation includes **user-configurable mass and velocity**, **wall bouncing**, and realistic physics-based velocity updates after collisions.

## 🚀 Features

- 🛶 Two object simulation in 1D space
- 🎯 Real-time elastic collision physics
- 📊 User inputs for:
  - Mass of both objects
  - Initial velocities (positive or negative)
- 🔁 Repeated collisions with each other and walls
- 🧮 Physics engine using momentum & energy conservation

*(Replace with your actual GitHub Pages/Netlify link)*

## 🧪 How It Works

1. The simulation runs in a `<canvas>` element.
2. Objects move according to initial velocity.
3. When they collide, new velocities are calculated using:
v1 = [(m1 - m2) * u1 + 2 * m2 * u2] / (m1 + m2)
v2 = [(m2 - m1) * u2 + 2 * m1 * u1] / (m1 + m2)

4. They also bounce off walls (velocity is reversed).
5. The update loop uses `setInterval()` to animate at ~33 FPS.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 Canvas
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS

## 💡 Potential Extensions

- Add kinetic energy and momentum visualization
- Show graphs of velocity over time
- Pause/Resume buttons
- Support for inelastic collisions
- Add labels for velocity/mass on each object
- Convert to 2D collision version

## 🎯 Should You Put It in Your Resume?

✅ **Yes — if you position it well.**

Use a one-line bullet like:

> 🛠️ Built an interactive browser-based 1D physics simulation using HTML Canvas and JavaScript, modeling elastic collisions with user-configurable mass and velocity inputs.

Or even better if:
- You add some graphs, statistics tracking, or visual polish.
- You demonstrate concepts like momentum conservation.
- You mention it under **"Physics + Programming"** or **"Frontend + Simulation"** skills.

---

### Want me to:
- Help host it live?
- Add graphs or velocity arrows?
- Turn this into a 2D collision or React app?

Just say the word — we can evolve this into something even more impressive!
